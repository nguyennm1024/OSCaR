## Code and Dataset Release Update

We are in the final stages of preparing the code and dataset for **OSCaR: Object State Captioning and State Change Representation**. Our team is currently focused on cleaning and finalizing the dataset and code to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and usability. 

We are committed to making our research accessible and reproducible, and we understand the importance of providing the community with the resources needed to explore and build upon our work. To this end, we are diligently working to prepare everything for publication.

Please stay tuned for updates. We will be releasing the code and dataset soon. Thank you for your interest and patience.
